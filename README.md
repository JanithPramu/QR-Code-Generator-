# QR Code Generator

This project generates a QR code image with customizable settings, such as version, box size, and border thickness. The QR code encodes a link to your GitHub profile.

## Features

- Customizable QR code version, box size, and border thickness.
- Generates a QR code for any URL.
- Saves the QR code as an image file.

## Requirements

This project requires Python and the `qrcode` library. You can install the library as follows:

```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JanithPramu/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python qr_generator.py
    ```

    This script will generate a QR code image with the specified data and save it as `test.png` in the current directory.

## Code Overview

Here's a breakdown of the main components of the code:

- **Import** the `qrcode` library.
- **Create an instance** of `QRCode`, configuring version, box size, and border settings.
- **Add data** to the QR code instance (`data` can be modified to encode any desired URL or text).
- **Generate the QR code image** and save it to the specified file (`test.png`).

## Example Output

The generated QR code image will look like this:

![QR Code Image](test.png)

This image can be scanned to open the encoded URL directly on a device.
